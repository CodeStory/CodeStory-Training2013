    <h2>Welcome to our 2013 Contest</h2>

    <p class="lead">Last year, we organized a challenge to select two developers that would pair with us at Devoxx
        France. With them, we also coded live at Devoxx World 2013. Time has come for them to defend their
        title. So here's a challenge to select challengers that will confront them during the final, a couple of
        weeks before Devoxx France 2013.</p>
